## Filtering Data in MySQL Using Aggregate Functions
# SQL-Revision
### **ðŸš€ Day 5 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and Filtering Data in MySQL Using Aggregate Functions. I have selected data from tables which was created from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days!** ###
### Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX. Here are some examples of how to use these functions in MySQL queries, ranging from basic to advanced scenarios.

### Aggregate Functions:
COUNT: Counts the number of rows.
SUM: Calculates the sum of a column's values.
AVG: Calculates the average of a column's values.
MIN: Finds the minimum value in a column.
MAX: Finds the maximum value in a column.
###  Grouping Data:
Use the GROUP BY clause to group rows sharing a property so that aggregate functions can be applied to each group.
Use the HAVING clause to filter groups based on aggregate functions.
